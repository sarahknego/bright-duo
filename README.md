Premise: Bright Duo is a page the houses the companyâ€™s independent projects. It also includes a form to submit information to get a quote from the team.

Technologies used: This project primarily used HTML and CSS, and JavaScript was used to help with the functionality of some of the features.

What does it do: The website displays the independent projects of the team in a carousel, and also has a form to submit information on the business that is inquiring and the services they can acquire from Bright Duo (at this time the form is not connected to a backend, so the information is not saved).

Challenges faced: The styling of the CSS of this project brought some challenges, the background of the form section took some trial and error to display properly, and I had to learn how to use media queries to adapt the webpage design for smaller screens. Additionally, I had some challenges trying to integrate JavaScript into the HTML of the webpage. The arrows and carousel took some effort to display and function correctly. At first there were also issues with the nav bar not scrolling to the correct spot on the page when a section was clicked.
